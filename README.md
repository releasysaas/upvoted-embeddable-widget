## How to install the widget in your web app

1. Load the widget on your page:

   ```html
   <script
     src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/releasysaas/upvoted-embeddable-widget@1.5.1/dist/widget.js"
     defer
     data-client-key="019483fc-b33e-7456-a5df-5bfa9ede6429"
     data-class-name="dark"
   ></script>
   ```

2. Replace the `data-client-key` value with the API token generated from the Upvoted backoffice.

3. Set the `data-class-name` value with `dark` to load the widget in dark mode, otherwise leave it blank.

### Embed the full board (new)

You can also embed the full board using the same script by switching the mode to `board`. This renders an inline Kanban similar to `UpvotedWeb.PublicOrgDashboardLive` using only the API Token endpoints (`/api/boards/*`).

Minimal example (inserts after the script tag):

```html
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/releasysaas/upvoted-embeddable-widget@1.5.1/dist/widget.js"
  defer
  data-mode="board"
  data-client-key="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
  data-class-name="dark"
></script>
```

Mount into a specific element:

```html
<div id="upvoted-board-here"></div>
<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/releasysaas/upvoted-embeddable-widget@1.5.1/dist/widget.js"
  defer
  data-mode="board"
  data-embed-target="#upvoted-board-here"
  data-height="700px"
  data-client-key="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
  data-class-name="dark"
  data-statuses="pending,in_progress,done"
></script>
```

Supported attributes in board mode:

- `data-mode`: `board` to enable board embed. Default is `widget`.
- `data-embed-target` (optional): CSS selector where the board should mount. If omitted, the board is appended to `document.body` after the script tag.
- `data-client-key`: your API token (required), used as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- `data-class-name` (optional): wrapper class, e.g. `dark`.
- `data-height` (optional): height to apply if the target has no explicit height. Defaults to `800px`.
- `data-statuses` (optional): comma-separated list of status names to include (lowercased). If empty or omitted, loads all statuses.

What it does:

- Calls `GET https://upvoted.io/api/boards/statuses` to build columns (ordered by `order`).
- Loads 5 features per status via `GET https://upvoted.io/api/boards/features?status=<status>&page=1&per_page=5`. Each column has a "Load more" button.
- Cards show title, votes/comments, image, and a two-line description preview.
- Clicking a card opens an in-widget modal that fetches `GET https://upvoted.io/api/boards/features/:id` and renders sanitized HTML description and HTML comments.
